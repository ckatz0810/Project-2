          threaten, embarrass, or target another person." Cyberbullying includes
          posting or sending harmful and negative content to or about someone
          else. <br />
          <br />
          It can occur all over the internet such as through social media sites,
          public chatrooms, text messages, emails, online video games, and
          direct messages. <br />

        <p id="slide2" class="slides">
          <span class="slidetitles" id="harassment">Harassment:</span> <br />

          The repeated enactment of abusive behavior or unwanted contact.
          Harassment can come in the form of emotional abusive such as
          aggressive texts or messages, or can be physically threatening. Cyber
          harassment can occur over text, email, phone, social media, or any
          site that allows for interaction with other online users.

          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="slidetitles" id="impersonation">Impersonation:</span>
          <br />

          The act of pretending to be someone that you are not in order to hurt
          someone else. The impersonator will act as someone close to the person
          they are attempting to hurt or even sometimes as someone famous. By
          impersonating someone they are not, bullies can gain access to secrets
          or potentially embarrassing stories they can use against the bullied.
          This can also be done in a fraudulent manner, where the bully uses a
          false identity to gain sensitive information from the victim.
          Impersonation can even be used to make someone fall in love with the
          impersonator, an action commonly termed “catfishing.”
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="slidetitles" id="doxing">Doxing:</span>
          <br />
          Revealing someones personal information to others online. This can be
          done in order to reveal information about someone that they may have
          wanted to keep private from the public in order to hurt them. Doxing
          can hurt the reputation of victims and even bring fraudulent activity
          their way.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="slidetitles" id="exclusion">Exclusion (Ostracism):</span>
          <br />
          Intentionally excluding someone from a group or conversation. A direct
          form of exclusion can come when the victim knows about being left out
          previously, but is then continually excluded in a malicious manner.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="slidetitles" id="flaming">Flaming:</span>
          <br />
          Often used to describe fights between two or more people in an online
          forum or site. It is notorious for the use of strong vulgar and angry
          insults and language. Flaming is not just restricted to fighting
          however, and can also be used to describe the action of using harsh
          language to make someone feel badly about themselves.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="slidetitles" id="trolling">Trolling:</span>
          <br />
          Saying something to someone or baiting them in order to get them to
          act a certain type of way or upset them. Trolling is done purely to
          see what type of reaction can be gotten out of a victim. It commonly
          comes in the form of negative comments on social media.
